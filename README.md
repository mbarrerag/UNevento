# UNevento

UNevento is a Spring Boot project designed to manage events with the help of Spring Security for authentication and authorization. This application provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on events and ensures secure access to these endpoints using Spring Security.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Create, read, update, and delete events.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access to endpoints using Spring Security.
- **RESTful API**: Provides RESTful endpoints for easy integration with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building and running the application.
- **Spring Security**: For securing the application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the database.
- **MySQL**: As the database to store event information.
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and building the project.
- **Java**: Programming language used to write the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/UNevento.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd UNevento
    ```

3. **Build the project**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

4. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/UNevento-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

## Usage

- **Accessing Endpoints**: The application provides various endpoints for event management. Refer to the API documentation or explore the code to understand the available endpoints and their functionality.
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints are protected using Spring Security. Users need to authenticate themselves before accessing protected resources.
